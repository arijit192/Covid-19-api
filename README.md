# Covid-19-api

I built this API so that everyone including me can take the advantage of realtime covid data to create awareness app and websites through which people can have an understanding of the current scenario.

The source of this data is directly from the website of Indian Govt(https://www.mygov.in/covid-19).

This api is also live and hosted on IBMCloud. You can have a look.

To get overall data of india send a get request to https://covid-tracker-api.eu-gb.cf.appdomain.cloud/total and to get data statewise it will be https://covid-tracker-api.eu-gb.cf.appdomain.cloud/statewise

Javascript version (Node.js) of this API is also available on my github. Link: https://github.com/arijit192/covid-india-api
